Problem Description:

Johny is very enthusiastic about programming languages. One day he tried to write a program to find a triple of numbers.



A triple of numbers is said to be "poor" when two of those numbers are equal and the other number is different from those two numbers. Help Johny to write the code.



You will be given three integers A, B, and C.

}
