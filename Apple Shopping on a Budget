Caleb and Irfan are purchasing apples that are priced according to their size, but their budget is limited.



To ensure they stay within budget, they plan to choose one small (apple1), one medium (apple2), and one large (apple3) apple.



Can you help them determine if their choices fit into their budget? Check the condition: if apple2 is greater than apple1 and apple3 is greater than apple2. If this condition is true, print "Fit into Budget"; otherwise, print "Doesn't fit into Budget.



Constraints:

1 ≤ apple1 ≤ 2000

1 ≤ apple2 ≤ 2000

1 ≤ apple3 ≤ 2000



Input format:

First Line: Single number of type integer representing the size of apple1

Second Line: Single number of type integer representing the size of apple2

Third Line: Single number of type integer representing the size of apple3



Output Format:

The output is a string representing: "Fit into Budget" or "Doesn't fit into Budget" based on the given condition.
